# Scrutiny

Scrutiny helps your Laravel 5.1+ project ensure that its current server environment is configured and running as planned.

## Problem

Have you ever been in the situation where you've moved servers and forgotten to:

1. Get your queue running?
2. Add the cron job to run your schedule?
3. Install an obscure program that your reporting uses once a month?
4. Enable a PHP extension that you need for an API?

This is the scenario Scrutiny was built to address â€“ use the availability monitor you have setup 
(like pingdom) to also monitor other important aspects of your environment.

This means your availability monitor notifies you of any problems with your server environment setup
instead of waiting for your clients or customers to tell you something is wrong.

## Installation

To install through composer, add the following to your `composer.json` file:

```json
{
    "require": {
        "brightmachine/scrutiny": "~1.0"
    }
}
```

And then run `composer install` from the terminal.

### Quick Installation

The installation instructions can be simplified using the following:

    composer require "brightmachine/scrutiny=~1.0"

### Add the Service Provider

Open `config/app.php` and the scrutiny service provider to :

```php
<?php
return [
    // â€¦

    'providers' => [
        // â€¦
        Scrutiny\ServiceProvider::class,
    ],
	
	// â€¦
];
```

You are all setup â€“ next step it to add your probes!

## How it works

1. In `AppServiceProvider::boot()`, configure the probes to check for all the things your environment needs in order to run 
2. Set up an `uptime check` in Pingdom to alert you if any of the probes fail to pass 

----

## What probes are available

All probes fall under the namespace `Scrutiny\Probes`:

- `AvailableDiskSpace`
- `Callback`
- `ConnectsToDatabase`
- `ConnectsToHttp`
- `ExecutableIsInstalled`
- `PhpExtensionLoaded`
- `QueueIsRunning`
- `ScheduleIsRunning`

Each check has its own parameters and can be used multiple times where it makes sense.

Some system checks may not be supported on Windows.

## How to configure the different probes

```php
<?php
namespace App\Providers;

use Illuminate\Support\ServiceProvider;

class AppServiceProvider extends ServiceProvider 
{
    public function boot()
    {
        // â€¦
        $this->configureScrutinyProbes();
    }
    
    public function register()
    {
    }
    
    protected function configureScrutinyProbes()
    {
        \Scrutiny\ProbeManager::configure()
            ->connectsToDatabase()
            ->executableIsInstalled('composer.phar')
            ->queueIsRunning(30, 'high')
            ->queueIsRunning(60, 'low')
            ;
    }
}

```

## Custom probes

Use the callback probe to add your own custom checks.

If a check should be skipped, throw a `\Scrutiny\ProbeSkippedException` and to fail
a check, throw any other kind of `Exception`:

```php
<?php
\Scrutiny\ProbeManager::configure()
    ->callback('my custom check', function () {
        if (should_i_skip_the_check()) {
            throw new \Scrutiny\ProbeSkippedException('check skipped');
        }
        
        if (should_i_fail_the_check()) {
            throw new \Exception('check failed');
        }
    });
``` 

----

## How to configure pingdom

Configure a new check in pingdom with the following setting:

1. Add an `uptime check` in pingdom to hit `https://yourdomain.com/~scrutiny/check-probes` where yourdomain.com is your production domain
2. Scrutiny will return an HTTP status of `590 Some Tests Failed` when something is awry â€“ this is a custom code
